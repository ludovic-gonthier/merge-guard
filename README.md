# Merge-Guard - Chrome Extension

Have you ever merged a PR where you left some `wip` or `fixup! `?

If you have, this plugin is for you. 

## Installation

The extension is published on the [Chrome WebStore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-merge-guard/nnapeeoeiddhbecmgehepihmndlkagdj?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog).

## How it works

When you're on a pull-request page, it will disable the Github merge button when it finds a commit message or a label containing `wip` ou `fixup`.

:warning: At the moment, the plugin only works on Github.
